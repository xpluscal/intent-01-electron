# Project Overview

## What We're Building

EcoTrack is a sustainability analytics platform that helps businesses track and reduce their carbon footprint. Think of it as "Google Analytics for carbon emissions" - making it easy for companies to measure, understand, and improve their environmental impact.

## The Problem

Companies want to be more sustainable but:
- They don't know where to start measuring
- Existing tools are complex and expensive
- Compliance reporting is time-consuming
- It's hard to track progress over time

## Our Solution

We make carbon tracking as simple as possible:
1. **Easy Setup** - Connect your data sources in minutes
2. **Automatic Tracking** - We calculate emissions from your existing data
3. **Clear Insights** - See where you can make the biggest impact
4. **One-Click Reports** - Generate compliance reports instantly

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **Sustainability Managers** - Need accurate data and reports
- **Operations Teams** - Want to identify efficiency improvements
- **Executives** - Need high-level dashboards and ROI metrics

### Company Types
- Mid-size companies (50-500 employees)
- Companies with sustainability goals
- Businesses facing regulatory requirements
- Organizations wanting to attract eco-conscious customers

## Core Features

### Must Have (MVP)
- Connect common data sources (utility bills, fleet data)
- Calculate Scope 1 & 2 emissions automatically
- Show emissions trends over time
- Generate basic compliance reports
- Set and track reduction goals

### Nice to Have (Future)
- Scope 3 emissions tracking
- AI-powered recommendations
- Supplier collaboration tools
- Carbon offset marketplace
- Mobile app for data entry

## Success Metrics

### Business Success
- Companies using the platform actively
- Emissions reduced by our users
- Time saved on reporting
- Customer retention rate

### User Success
- Time from signup to first insight < 30 minutes
- Users log in at least weekly
- Reports generated without support
- Reduction goals achieved

## Technical Approach

### Design Principles
- **Simple First** - Start with the easiest solution
- **Data Accuracy** - Better to be accurate than feature-rich
- **User Privacy** - Customer data is sacred
- **Fast Feedback** - Show value quickly

### Key Decisions
- Web-first (mobile app can come later)
- Real-time where it matters, batch where it doesn't
- Buy integrations, build core features
- Progressive enhancement over perfection

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- Basic emissions calculation
- Simple data input methods
- Core dashboard views
- Essential reporting

### Phase 2: Growth
- More data source integrations
- Team collaboration features
- Advanced analytics
- API for developers

### Phase 3: Scale
- Industry benchmarking
- Predictive analytics
- White-label options
- Global expansion

## Team Values

### How We Work
- **User feedback drives decisions** - Talk to users weekly
- **Ship small, ship often** - Daily deployments are normal
- **Quality over quantity** - Better to do less, well
- **Learn from mistakes** - Failures are learning opportunities

### What We Care About
- Making sustainability accessible to all businesses
- Building something people actually want to use
- Creating a positive environmental impact
- Growing a sustainable business (pun intended)

## Getting Started

New to the project? Here's what to know:
1. Our users are busy - respect their time
2. Accuracy matters more than features
3. We're building for non-experts
4. Every feature should drive emissions reduction

Remember: We're not just building software, we're helping save the planet, one business at a time.
